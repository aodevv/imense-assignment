# imense-assignment
This the final version I'll be submitting for the 'Imense Assignment', the teck stack I used consists of the following:
Vite
ReactJS
React-table
Framer-motion: for some DOM rendering animations.
SASS: 99% of styling was done using SASS the remaining 1% was the deault styles provided by the datepicker library I used which I then overwritten to custom style it.
react-daterange-picker: this is the component that I wished I had improved in time to match the required design, first I wanted to develop my custom datepicker but seeing that it could take me more time I decided to use a library.

First I was hesitant on using redux for managing state but since there's little data to work with and the assignment was mainly focusing on UI design elements I decided to use variables instead, I could easily hook up a redux store and move everything.

I would also like to add that I can better refactor and optimize my code since I was focusing on delivering the result on time, I left some areas of improvments like storing all colors in variables...
